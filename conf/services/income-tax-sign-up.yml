accessibilityProblems:
  - when using the Welsh translation screen reader users will have difficulties understanding the address lookup error message as their screen reader will pronounce the English copy as Welsh.
  - the ‘your responsibilities if you choose online’ has not been built as a heading so screen reader users will not understand the set up of content.
milestones:
  - description: |
      the ‘error’ prefix on error messages does not have the appropriate ‘lang=en’ attribute that causes screen readers to mispronounce the words. 3.1.2 Language of parts.

  - description: |
      the ‘your responsibilities if you choose online’ copy introduces the subsequent content and visually acts as a heading, but it is only a visual treatment and confers no semantic meaning or page structure to screen readers. This fails WCAG 2.1.
