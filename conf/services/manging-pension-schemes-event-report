- On the ‘Unauthorised payments’ page screen-reader users will find it difficult to understand the content in the tables.
- On the ‘Member’s details’ page the National Insurance number error message does not clearly say what needs to be corrected.
- On the ‘What you will need’ page screen-reader users will find it difficult to understand the information in the downloadable instruction file.
- When switching to the Welsh version, some of the text has not been translated into Welsh. This gives information that is not complete to users and will not be correctly pronounced by screen readers.
