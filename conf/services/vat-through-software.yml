  - On the ‘Submitted return’ page, screen-reader users will not be aware if any of the values are negative within the summary table.
  - Screen-reader users will find it difficult to understand the structure of the ‘Submitted return’ page as the headings have not been used correctly.
  - The downloaded PDF does not have a document title which will make it difficult to identify correctly.
  - The language for the document content has not been set, so screen readers may not pronounce the content correctly.
