accessibilityProblems:
  - On pages with a sortable table, screen reader users may not be aware that the buttons in the table headers allow the column data to be sorted.
  - The 'Which access groups would you like to add' pages may have multiple checkboxes that are not grouped which can make it difficult to know what they relate to.
  - On the 'Manage access groups' page, there is no skip link for keyboard users to bypass the filters which is available on other search pages.
  - On the 'Manage clients in this group' page, if the user does not enter or select a search filter there is no error message.
  - When switching to the Welsh language version, the 'Welcome to your agent services account' page and the pages with a sortable table, have some copy which remains in English and will not be correctly pronounced by screen readers. This includes the show and hide text, the sort by, ascending and descending text.
