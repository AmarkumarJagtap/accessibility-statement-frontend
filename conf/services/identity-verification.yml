serviceDescription: |
  This service allows you to confirm your identity online, which then gives
  you access to Government Gateway services. It confirms the link between a person’s
  credentials and their identity by asking a set of questions, helping us to be sure
  that the person using the service is who they claim to be.

accessibilityProblems:
  - The instructions for currency fields throughout the service suggests that pound signs can be included but service does not allow that.
  - On ‘choose 2 items we can ask you about’ page error, ‘select 2 items we can ask you about’ appears when the user has selected 2 options. Some of the errors may be missed by screen-reader users as they are nested. The same problem occurs for nested options for payslips, P60s or country of origin for driving licences. It may be hard to correct errors and identify the page structure for screen-reader users.
  - The name field for passport and driving licence details do not offer users the option to populate the fields from data that is already saved in their browser.
  - When users return to the previous page, their previously entered date of birth answers are removed, so they need to answer questions again.
  - Users are not able to check their answers before trying to submit the application.
  - When users switch to Welsh on the ‘We are processing your details’ page, the loading symbol is not translated for screen-reader users.
