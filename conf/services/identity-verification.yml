accessibilityProblems:
  - On ‘choose 2 items we can ask you about’ page error, ‘select 2 items we can ask you about’ appears when the user has selected 2 options. Some of the errors may be missed by screen-reader users as they are nested. The same problem occurs for nested options for payslips, P60s or country of origin for driving licences. It may be hard to correct errors and identify the page structure for screen-reader users.
  - The name field for passport and driving licence details do not offer users the option to populate the fields from data that is already saved in their browser.
