  This service allows you to confirm your identity online, which then gives
  you access to Government Gateway services. It confirms the link between a person’s
  credentials and their identity by asking a set of questions, helping us to be sure
  that the person using the service is who they claim to be.

accessibilityProblems:
  - On all currency inputs, screen-reader users will not be aware that the value needs to be entered in pounds (£). The error messages for these pages do not clearly describe the problem that needs to be resolved.
  - On ‘choose 2 items we can ask you about’ page error, ‘select 2 items we can ask you about’ appears when the user has selected 2 options. Screen-reader users cannot correctly identify the error messages and the content appearing on choosing options.
  - Screen-reader users cannot correctly identify the information presented by the images.
  - The list of addresses are mixed and not displayed in the correct order. Users may find it difficult to get the correct information.
  - On the ‘when did you last open a personal current account?’ and ‘when did you last take out or renew a personal mobile phone contract?’ pages, the error messages are missing.
  - Screen-reader users are not notified when new content appears after selecting ‘no’ on the ‘we cannot confirm who you are’ page.
  - Screen-reader users may not be able to identify the question for the ‘yes, try again’ and ‘no’ button group.
  - The date input error messages on ‘enter your UK photocard driving licence details’ page are not giving users the correct instructions.
  - The error prefix is not translated for Welsh speaking users, which could prevent them from correctly identifying text as an error. Additionally, assistive technology may not pronounce it correctly.
  - The date of birth fields do not offer users the option to populate the answer from the data that is saved in their browser.
  - When users enter an invalid postcode, the error message suggests they have not entered anything. This can mislead them about what needs to be corrected.
  - The labels for radio options are not translated for Welsh speaking users. Additionally, assistive technology may not pronounce it correctly on the ‘when did you last open a personal current account?’ and the ‘when did you last take out or renew a personal mobile phone contract?’ pages.
  - The labels on the ‘enter the pensions and benefits information from your tax return’ page are not clear and sufficiently descriptive. This may prevent users from submitting the correct information.
  - On the Welsh version, the alt text for the loading image is in English but not marked up as English text for screen readers. This means that assistive technology may not pronounce it correctly.
