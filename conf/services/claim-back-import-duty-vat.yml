accessibilityProblems:
  - Some users may find it difficult to understand the purpose of pages with the file upload control as there are some inputs that do not have a label associated with it. They may find it difficult resolving any errors or removing uploaded files.
  - When navigating the 'Claims summary' section using the search or pagination, screen reader users may not realise a new page has loaded as the page title stays the same.
  - On the 'Check your answers before sending your claim' page, the change links for the uploaded files do not correctly let users know where they will be taken.
  - On the 'Enter the Movement Reference Number (MRN)' page, users need to enter the data again when there is an error.
