accessibilityProblems:
  - On the page to change the main address, there are 3 ‘change’ links that are not descriptive. People using screen readers are unable to tell which link helps them to do which task.
  - On the page to change the postal address, there are 3 ‘change’ links that are not descriptive. People using screen readers are unable to tell which link helps them to do which task.
  - On the page to find user ID, there is no heading on the pop up that says the session is about to timeout.  This may be confusing for screen reader users as they may not understand that there is a pop up and what it is for.
  - On the view messages page, the ‘skip to main to main content’ link is not working for people using assistive technology.
  - On the page to enter an international address, there is no pop up that tells people that the session is about to timeout. This is confusing for people using screen readers.
  - Throughout the service, when in the top navigation, people using a keyboard to tab through find that the link when activating the account expands into a drop down. The drop down remains open even when the user navigates away from it.  Users need to navigate back to close it.
  - On the page to enter an international address, the error messages are too general. They are also repeated and do not give a good description.
  - On the page to enter an international address, the option to auto complete the form does not appear. This option helps users to fill the address fields automatically which cuts down on errors.
  - On the page to print a national insurance summary, an email address appears over 2 lines when the browser is significantly magnified. This will affect low vision users or any users that prefer to read the page in a single column.
  - On the personal tax account page, National Insurance content overlaps and becomes hard to read when the text spacing technique is being used. Text spacing gives more space between content to help the user with reading.
  - On the page to print a national insurance summary, the colour contrast does not meet the minimum requirements. This makes it difficult to see and read especially for users with low vision or colour blindness.
  - On the tax credits choice page, the colour contrast does not meet the minimum requirements. This makes it difficult to see and read especially for users with low vision or colour blindness.
