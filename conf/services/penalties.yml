accessibilityProblems:
  - On the ‘Late payment penalty’ page, the importance of the content is hidden from assistive technology. Screen-reader users may find it difficult to identify the importance of the information about the penalty.
  - Welsh users will have difficulties when using the Welsh version, as the ‘view calculation’ link and the ‘contents’ copy is not translated into Welsh.
milestones:
  - description: When viewing the page in Welsh some parts of the service are missing the necessary translations. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.1.2 Language of parts.
