accessibilityProblems:
  - After adding a business to your undertaking account, a ‘success banner’ displays. The focus for keyboard users is on the banner, and not at the top of the page, which can cause confusion.
  - The table on the ‘Reported payment history’ page has 5 headings but 6 items in the row. The sixth item does not have a heading. Screen-reader users may not understand which payment is being removed when selecting the link.
  - The ‘Reported payment history’ displays the content as a description list on a reduced screen size. As it is within a table, there is no description list. Screen-reader users may not understand how the items relate to each other.
  - On the 'reporting de minimis aid payments (less Customs Duty waivers) as a single undertaking' page, the heading is not set up correctly so that screen reader users do not know that it is a heading
  - On the 'report a de minimis aid payment' page, the table is stacked on smaller screens but has not been correctly set up which can cause confusion for screen reader users
