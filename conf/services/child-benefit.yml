  - When switching to the Welsh version, screen-reader users may not be able to identify the 'Error' prefix for page title when the page has loaded, as it has not been translated.
  - When users enter mismatching bank details, they are taken to the 'Sorry there is a problem with the service' page without a clear understanding or a specific error message.
