  - Screen-reader users will not be able to correctly identify the questions that they need to answer when populating the date fields and confirming the address.
  - On the 'Your Child Benefit is paid into this account' page, the tables have not been set up correctly so screen-reader users will find it difficult to understand the content in them.
  - When switching to the Welsh version, screen-reader users may not be able to identify the 'Error' prefix for page title when the page has loaded, as it has not been translated.
  - When users enter mismatching bank details, they are taken to the 'Sorry there is a problem with the service' page without a clear understanding or a specific error message.
