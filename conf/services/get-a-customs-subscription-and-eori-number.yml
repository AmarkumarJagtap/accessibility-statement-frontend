complianceStatus: partial
accessibilityProblems:
  - The headings or associated hint text for ‘EORI application contact details’ and ‘Is this the email address you want to use’ pages are missing email addresses to help screen-reader users to confirm that they will get their EORI number sent to the correct email address.
  - On ‘Application contact details’, ‘Date when the company was established’ and ‘What is your Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code?’ pages, there is information relevant to the form which may be missed if navigating with a screen-reader by form fields or by moving directly to the fields.
  - On ‘Date when the company was established’, ‘Enter your details’ and ‘Your UK VAT details’ pages, the error messages for date fields are not specific enough, misleading and some error message links are empty. This can prevent users from identifying what needs to be corrected.
  - The date fields on the ‘Date when the company was established’, ‘Enter your details’ and ‘Your UK VAT details’ pages do not correctly identify errors which makes it difficult for users to identify and correct them.
  - The timestamp for the EORI number is communicated to screen-reader users as a heading. This can confuse screen-reader users on how the page is structured. It does not describe the further content on the ‘Subscription request received’ page.
  - The downloaded ‘Your payment plan’ PDF does not have a document title which will make it difficult to identify correctly. The language for the document has not been set correctly, so screen readers may not pronounce the content correctly. When the document is magnified, the content does not reflow and needs horizontal scrolling which makes it difficult to read. The HMRC logo is missing a text description for screen-reader users.
  - When switching to the Welsh language version the visually hidden ‘Error’ prefix for error messages throughout the service is missing the Welsh translation. It will not be correctly pronounced by screen readers.
