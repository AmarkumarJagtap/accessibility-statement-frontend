serviceName: Set up a limited company and register for Corporation Tax
serviceDescription: The Company Registration Service is to register your company with Companies House. You will be registered for Corporation Tax at the same time. You’ll get a ‘certificate of incorporation’. This confirms the company legally exists and shows the company number and date of formation. You can also use this service to register for PAYE to tell HMRC you’re employing staff (including yourself if you’re the only director) or continue an application if you’ve already started registering.

milestones:

  - description: A decorative image has been assigned alternative text which reads as ‘[Image of Memorandum of Association front cover]’.This may be confusing for screen reader users as it is not clear what the image represents. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text Content).
    date: 2023-03-31
  - description: On one page, when multiple checkboxes are selected, they expand to reveal a further input to add the user’s details. However, the other inputs on the page turn a light grey colour. This may affect low-vision users who may find difficulty in distinguishing the grey text against the white background. This fails WCAG 2.1 1.4.3 (Contrast minimum).
    date: 2023-03-31
  - description: When one page is set to reflow settings, the text adjacent to the radio button spills off the page. This issue may affect low- vision users who use reflow settings to view web pages from being able to clearly read the content. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.10 (Reflow).
