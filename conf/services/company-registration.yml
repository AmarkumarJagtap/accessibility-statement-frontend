serviceName: Set up a limited company and register for Corporation Tax
serviceDescription: The Company Registration Service is to register your company with Companies House. You will be registered for Corporation Tax at the same time. You’ll get a ‘certificate of incorporation’. This confirms the company legally exists and shows the company number and date of formation. You can also use this service to register for PAYE to tell HMRC you’re employing staff (including yourself if you’re the only director) or continue an application if you’ve already started registering.
