milestones:
  - description: "Multiple main landmarks are present that are not implemented according to specification. Screen readers can use landmarks to determine the structure of the page and to navigate between different sections quickly. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.1 (parsing), 1.3.1 (info and relationships) and 1.3.6 (identify purpose)."
    date: 2022-10-06
  - description: "A page contained multiple level 1 headings. Screen reader users rely on a sole descriptive level 1 heading, providing the user with a clear purpose of the page and the content contained within. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships)."
    date: 2022-10-06
  - description: "The PDF document has not been tagged and therefore is not accessible for screen reader users as the content has not been provided using the correct tags allowing for users to discern the structure and relations of content. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships) and 3.1.1 (language of page)."
    date: 2022-10-06
  - description: "When the ‘Start now’ button receives focus, the only change for users to distinguish the focus state, is the colour of the button changes from one shade of green, to a darker shade of green. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.1 (use of colour)."
    date: 2022-10-06
  - description: "'Previous claims' and 'Tax year' introduces content but is not marked up as part of as heading structure. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criteria 1.3.1 (info and relationships) and 4.1.2 (name, role, value)."
    date: 2022-10-06

    date: 2022-10-06
  - description: "The ARIA attribute aria-selected indicates the current 'selected' state of various widgets; in this instance an aria-selected=false value has been associated with the input, which is not permitted for the elements role. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criteria 4.1.2 (name, role, value)."
    date: 2022-10-06
  - description: "Each of the inputs contained within the fieldset have multiple labelling techniques applied; an aria-labelledby attribute has been used on the radio buttons that refers to the label used in the <legend>. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criteria 1.3.1 (info and relationships), 3.3.2 (labels or instructions) and 4.1.2 (name, role, value)."
    date: 2022-10-06
  - description: "In places focus order was illogical, with content being bypassed, content which should not be focusable being included in the tab order, and in places, on page load focus was placed in the body of the page, rather than at the top which was confusing for screen readers. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criteria 2.4.3 (focus order)."
    date: 2022-10-06
  - description: "The content has been presented using spans, divs and list items, rather than a definition list as would typically be expected to ensure that relationships between content is portrayed in the same way as it is visually.

    date: 2022-10-06

    date: 2022-10-06

    date: 2022-10-06
  - description: "The focus indicator throughout the service does not match that of the requirements set by the GOV.UK Design System. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criteria 1.4.11 (non-text contrast)."
