accessibilityProblems:
  - When an error shows, the ‘error’ prefix does not currently show on the page title. People who use screen-readers may not know that the page contains errors. We plan to add the ‘Error’ prefix to all page titles when an error shows.
  - When an error has been triggered, it is not clear for screen reader users that this error is different from any other text on the screen. We will add in the word ‘error’ to make it clearer that an error has been triggered.
  - When using the tab key to navigate the page, there is important information that is placed after the ‘Continue’ button. People using screen readers may miss this information. We plan to make sure all important information is above the continue button so this is not missed.
  - Some page titles do not include the name of the service. We plan to add the name of the service to all page titles.
  - On all pages, hints are not linked to the fields they relate to. This means they will not be read by assistive technology if the user moves straight to the field. We will fix this so they are all linked to the field and read out properly.
  - If there are multiple error messages on a screen, the list of messages are not displayed in the same order as the form fields on the page. We plan to display the error links in the same order as the form input fields.
  - Some of the information is read out twice by a screen reader because the designs do not follow the pattern. We will fix this so that all of the information is only read once.
milestones:

      When using assistive technologies, some buttons describe the URL of the page instead of describing what the buttons do.
      This fails WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A) Understanding Name, Role, Value, How to Meet Name, Role, Value.
      We plan to fix this error and add the correct descriptive label to each button.
