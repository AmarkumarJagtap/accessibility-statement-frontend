accessibilityProblems:
  - the menu toggle in the banner on a small screen disappears when clicked.
  - ”Home” navigation option is not selected using a voice command.
  - some elements present that had a colour used for styling focus indication that did not pass the expected ratio.
  - page <title> does not follow pattern.
  - error page title is the same as the original page title.
  - no keyboard focus on buttons in high contrast mode.
  - combine heading and label to reduce noise for screen reader and add/associate hint.
  - error messages are not associated to inputs.
  - single input therefore a <legend> is not required.
  - duplicate “class” attribute causing HTML error.
  - the value of the “for” attribute of the “label” element must be the ID of a non-hidden form control.
  - incorrect spelling of class attribute.
