accessibilityProblems:
  - At one point we display a payment iFrame, which is controlled by Barclaycard. Visually impaired users may find it difficult to navigate, even with assistive technology.
  - There are some error messages in this service that may not be descriptive enough for some users with visual impairments - however they are compatible with common assistive technology tools.
  - At some points we display pages where the formatting for individual elements on screen are not fully suitable for screen reading technologies and results in a difficult to navigate page due to incomplete information. However using a screen reader to read back the entire page will provide all the information needed to navigate the page with confidence.

      We use a Barclaycard iFrame to take the card details and payments for the
      charge or tax users are paying. This iFrame does not give users the chance
      to confirm their details once they have entered them. This does not meet
      WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.3.6 (Error Prevention).

      We use titles on our webpages in order to describe the topic or purpose of
      the page that the user is currently viewing. In some instances, the Tab titles
      and main titles are not consistent. This means the service does not meet WCAG 2.1
      success criterion 2.4.6 (Headings and Labels).

      We use page headings and subheadings to describe the topic or purpose of fields
      in a webpage. On certain pages there are level 3 headings that are actually level 2
      headings, which causes people using screen readers to receive unclear information
      regarding the page. This means the service does not meet WCAG success criterion
      2.4.10 (Section Headings).

      We use radio buttons to present users with options on our webpages, these are
      grouped together to enable easier navigation for keyboard only users. In some
      instances, these groups are missing their labelling, which prevents some screen
      reading software from narrating the label. This means the service does not meet
      WCAG success criterion 2.4.6 (Headings and Labels).
