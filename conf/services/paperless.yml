serviceDescription: |
 The Digital Contact Preference service allows HMRC customers to choose how they get their tax letters, such as notices to file returns, or penalties. Customers can select traditional post, or can choose to receive online tax letters. Selecting online tax letters means the service sends the customer some of these key tax letters to a secure inbox. The customer can then access them at any time. HMRC holds these letters for 7 years.
