accessibilityProblems:
  - When the downloaded PDF is magnified, the content does not reflow and needs horizontal scrolling which makes it more difficult to read. Users’ answers and questions have not been marked up properly and will not be associated correctly by screen readers.
  - The address fields do not offer users the option to populate the fields from data that was previously saved in the browser.
  - On the 'What is the country of your address?' page the error message is not translated for Welsh speaking users, which could prevent them from correctly identifying text as an error.
  - On the 'What is your full name?' page there is information relevant to the form which may be missed by screen-reader users.
  - On the 'Your legal interpretation' page, the warning icon has no alternate text so its meaning is missing for screen-reader users.
  - On the 'You have added countries or territories' and the 'offshore liabilities summary' pages, the remove and change links do not provide sufficient context for screen-reader users to determine where the link will take them.
  - The downloaded PDF 'Digital Disclosure Service' does not have the language set for the document. Screen readers may not pronounce the content correctly. When the document is zoomed, the content does not reflow and needs horizontal scrolling which makes it more difficult to read.
  - On the 'In which country or territory are your offshore liabilities?' page, the text field causing the error is not identified.
  - Some headings on some pages may not correctly convey information for assistive technologies or display it inconsistently across browsers due to the HTML tags not being set up correctly.
  - Some buttons in the service act like links. Keyboard-only users may have problems as they must use the enter key instead of the spacebar. Assistive technology users will have problems with these buttons as they have not been set up correctly.
  - Some form labels do not provide enough information for screen-reader users to identify what data needs to be entered.
  - When using the VoiceOver screen-reader on iOS, some content is not read out in the downloaded PDF 'Digital Disclosure Service'. Other content in the summary lists is not read out in the order that it is displayed.
  - Some pages do not have descriptive titles and headings, so users may not correctly identify what the content is.
  - On the 'View, edit or create a case' page, the edit links do not provide sufficient context for screen-reader users to determine where the link will take them.
  - The downloaded PDF 'Digital Disclosure Service' does not have the correct language set for the document. Screen readers may not pronounce the content correctly.
  - On the 'View, edit or create a case' page, the 'Create a new case' button acts like a link. Keyboard-only users may have problems as they must use the enter key instead of the spacebar. Assistive technology users will have problems with these buttons as they have not been set up correctly.
  - On the 'View, edit or create a case' page, the table does not reflow the content when zoomed. Horizontal scrolling is necessary which makes it difficult to read.
  - The downloaded PDF 'Digital Disclosure Service' does not reflow the content when zoomed. This means horizontal scrolling is needed which makes it difficult to read.
