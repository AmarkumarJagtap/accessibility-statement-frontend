accessibilityProblems:
- When the downloaded PDF is magnified, the content does not reflow and needs horizontal scrolling which makes it more difficult to read. Users’ answers and questions have not been marked up properly and will not be associated correctly by screen readers.
- The address fields do not offer users the option to populate the fields from data that was previously saved in the browser.
- On the ‘What is the country of your address?’ page, the error message has not been translated into Welsh, which could prevent Welsh-speaking users from correctly identifying it as an error.
- On the ‘What is your full name?’ page there are details describing the format of the information required, that may be missed by screen-reader users.
